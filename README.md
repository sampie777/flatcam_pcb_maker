This quick-and-dirity tool was created to assist me in generating Gcode for creating PCBs using my 3D printer. 

The tool is used in combination with EAGLE (9.7v) and FlatCAM (8.5v) software. 

## Workflow

1. Create and design your PCB in EAGLE.
2. Generate gerber and excellon files using the CAM processer in EAGLE.
3. Open this tool and choose your project.
4. Generate the commands for FlatCAM.
5. Paste these commands in the console of FlatCAM (these commands are automatically copied to your clipboard).
6. Hit Enter and let FlatCAM do its thing.
7. Now modify the Gcode output using this tool.
8. Your Gcode files are now ready to use!
